# frog_problem
Here is the frog problem code I wrote in an Edinburgh pub.

Feel free to make better version. This one has not changed since I wrote it. V1 was the same code but saved before I changed it to work for different distances so I have not bothered upload it as well (it was still very unifinished).

## The problem

A frog is on one side of the pond and wants to get on the other side. There are ùëõ lily leaves ahead in a line, the ùëõ-th leave laying on the other end of the pond and being the destination. Whatever the position the frog is at any time, it will only go ahead and the probability to land on one of the leaves left in front of it (including the destination) is uniform. For example, if we have 10 leaves ahead, there is a probability of 110 that it will land on any of them.

a) What is the expected value for the number of jumps it will take the frog to arrive to the destination leaf? 
b) Can you come up with a formula for that? (It can't be a recursive expression...)
